Create a class “Car” that counts how many cars it has produced.

Let all the cars have 5 wheels (4 driving and 1 spare) and black color by default.

Red cars should have only 4 wheels (no spare wheels for red cars! J).

All cars must have a method called “diag”, that prints out the color of the car and its wheels count.

Mind the ‘__init__’ method.

 

From now on, the solutions are completely up to you, just make it work and make it as efficient and as easy to read, as you can.
